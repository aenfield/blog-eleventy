    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve recently traveled in Japan and now see &#39;Jieiarunishinihon&#39; on your credit card statement, it&#39;s a charge from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/&quot;&gt;JR West&lt;/a&gt;, at least in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an amazing time backpacking around Japan for two weeks a few months ago. I noticed charges with this name and didn&#39;t know what they were. The credit card company had categorized them as &#39;shopping&#39;. Searching online at the time, I didn&#39;t find anything solid that explained the name, and nothing related to JR West, but when I looked more closely, the charges and dates matched up. Turns out, thanks to ChatGPT (and assuming it&#39;s correct here), I now know that jieiarunishinihon is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese&quot;&gt;romaji&lt;/a&gt; transliteration for &amp;quot;JR West&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Jie&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;J&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;iaru&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;nishi&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;west&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;nihon&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;Japan&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I only traveled in JR West territory for part of the trip, I found their website the best for buying tickets online, even for JR Central and JR East areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(When I had this blog in the early 2000s, a post I&#39;d written explaining how to resolve a particular error message ended up as the first Google search result for that error message. I got emails from folks saying the post helped. If this post helps folks also, that would be great. And if no one ever sees it, it&#39;s still helping me get back in the swing of writing regularly.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hello world</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a first blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://11ty.dev&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt; static site generator, and write and publish using files with Markdown, Git branches, and GitHub Actions. Compared to the ASP.NET-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480016.aspx&quot;&gt;DasBlog&lt;/a&gt; engine I used with the first blog with this name, way back in the early 2000s, this approach is cleaner, takes advantage of version control and CI/CD, and doesn&#39;t require a server that runs code. All pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;
