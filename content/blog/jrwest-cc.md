If you've recently traveled in Japan and now see 'Jieiarunishinihon' on your credit card statement, it's a charge from [JR West](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/), at least in my experience.

I had an amazing time backpacking around Japan for two weeks a few months ago. I noticed charges with this name and didn't know what they were. The credit card company had categorized them as 'shopping'. Searching online at the time, I didn't find anything solid that explained the name, and nothing related to JR West, but when I looked more closely, the charges and dates matched up. Turns out, thanks to ChatGPT (and assuming it's correct here), I now know that jieiarunishinihon is the [romaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese) transliteration for "JR West". "Jie" is "J", "iaru" is "R", "nishi" is "west", and "nihon" is "Japan".

While I only traveled in JR West territory for part of the trip, I found their website the best for buying tickets online, even for JR Central and JR East areas.

(When I had this blog in the early 2000s, a post I'd written explaining how to resolve a particular error message ended up as the first Google search result for that error message. I got emails from folks saying the post helped. If this post helps folks also, that would be great. And if no one ever sees it, it's still helping me get back in the swing of writing regularly.)
