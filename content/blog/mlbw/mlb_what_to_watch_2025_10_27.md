Here are today's MLB games, ordered by watchability, based on how interesting the teams and starting pitchers look. Higher is better. For more information, [read this post](https://andrewenfield.com/blog/2025/08/07/how-to-choose-which-baseball-game-to-watch).

Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Toronto Blue Jays @ Los Angeles Dodgers, 5:00p

### Summary

**Scherzer’s last-act craft meets Glasnow’s height-and-heat in a 1–1 World Series swing game, and that contrast alone is worth your eyeballs.** **With a gNERD that sits near the historical upper quartile, this grades as an above-average watch driven by one premium arm and two offenses capable of quick-strike damage.**

Glasnow owns the better pNERD and the stuff to match it (xFIP- edge, 95.9 mph), plus he’s allowed one run in 13.1 postseason innings with 18 strikeouts, the kind of swing-and-miss profile this model rewards.  Scherzer’s pNERD lags, but he just gave Toronto 5.2 solid ALCS frames (2 ER) and now gets his first World Series start since 2019—and for a fourth different team, no less.  Jays watchability also rides on elite defense (strong fielding runs) supporting above-average bats, while LA brings barrel rate thump and a top-graded bullpen. The Dodgers’ relief corps should be fully rested after Yamamoto’s Game 2 complete game that knotted the series.  Bo Bichette’s World Series activation adds another skilled bat to Toronto’s mix, even if his role toggles by inning.  Net: Glasnow-powered whiffs vs. Scherzer’s sequencing, with enough offense on both sides to keep channel-flipping to a minimum.
