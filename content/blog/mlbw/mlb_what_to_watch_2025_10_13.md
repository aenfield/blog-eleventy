Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Los Angeles Dodgers @ Milwaukee Brewers, 5:08p

### Summary

**This NLCS Game 1 matchup delivers a compelling paradox: the defending champion Dodgers, who lost all six regular season meetings to Milwaukee, send their postseason ace Blake Snell against an undetermined Brewers starter in what shapes up as one of the more watchable games in recent memory.** The gNERD score of 15.26 sits well above the historical median and ranks at the top of today's slate, driven by strong team components from both sides and Snell's excellent 8.26 pNERD.

Snell has been excellent in two starts this postseason, striking out 18 against five walks and allowing just two runs across 13 innings, and his underlying metrics support the dominance—a 75 xFIP- (25% better than league average) and elite 20% swinging-strike rate. The Brewers counter with uncertainty at the mound, having deployed bullpen games throughout their NLDS against the Cubs, which adds intrigue to the pitching matchup. Milwaukee's 9.71 tNERD is exceptional, boosted by elite baserunning (2.12 component) and strong bullpen performance, while their younger roster (1.14 age component) provides energy. The Dodgers lost all six games to Milwaukee during the regular season, all within a two-week span in July, giving this series opener added narrative weight as Los Angeles looks to reverse that trend on baseball's biggest stage.

## Seattle Mariners @ Toronto Blue Jays, 2:03p

### Summary

**This ALCS Game 2 matchup features Seattle's ace Logan Gilbert against Toronto's breakout rookie sensation Trey Yesavage, with the Blue Jays looking to even the series after dropping the opener.** Gilbert brings one of the highest pitcher watchability scores today with a 70 xFIP- and elite swinging-strike rate, while Yesavage struck out 11 Yankees in 5⅓ no-hit innings in his last outing. The gNERD score of 13.98 sits comfortably above the historical average and ranks as the lowest among today's games, driven primarily by Gilbert's stellar 10.15 pNERD that places him in the 95th percentile historically. Both teams bring solid batting numbers that contribute positively to watchability, though Toronto's defense stands out with 1.61 runs above average compared to Seattle's below-average fielding. The Mariners haven't been to this round since 2001 and have never won the AL pennant, adding weight to every pitch. Gilbert's quick 20.8-second pace between pitches keeps things moving, though his luck component suggests he's been underperforming his peripherals and could be due for regression. The combination of ace-versus-rookie intrigue and genuine championship stakes makes this worth your attention.
