Here are today's MLB games, ordered by watchability, based on how interesting the teams and starting pitchers look. Higher is better. For more information, [read this post](https://andrewenfield.com/blog/2025/08/07/how-to-choose-which-baseball-game-to-watch).

Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Toronto Blue Jays @ Los Angeles Dodgers, 5:00p

### Summary

**World Series rubber match energy with an actual pitching plot: Blake Snell’s swing-and-miss machine meets Toronto’s rookie wildfire Trey Yesavage in a rematch the bat-to-ball gods actually care about. The gNERD is a robust 13.90—comfortably above the historical median—because the watchability math and the storylines both hum.**

Snell’s pNERD (8.26) is buoyed by an elite xFIP- around 75, and he just authored an NLCS Game 1 masterpiece (8 scoreless, 10 K, 0 BB) before getting nicked in this series’ opener, when Toronto detonated a nine-run sixth.  Yesavage’s pNERD is a data blank only because the sample is newborn; the entertainment isn’t—he set a Blue Jays postseason record with 11 strikeouts in his ALDS debut and has since held his own on the biggest stage.  Add that the series sits level after Toronto’s Game 4 win featuring Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s club-record seventh postseason homer, and the stakes match the stuff.  The models like the shape of this: Dodgers’ tNERD leans on barrels and a strong pen, while Toronto brings elite defense and real thump. If you want bat speed vs. swing-and-miss and a rookie’s audacity against a two-time Cy winner, this is today’s best bet to feel big.
