As of this morning the pybaseball APIs for pitching and team stats from FanGraphs are failing with 403 errors. This has happened before, judging from the pybaseball issues list, and without any documented resolution. Maybe it's a server issue that'll get resolved.

For now I'm turning off automatic daily generation of posts.

Regardless, my code should handle things differently. My issue tracking this is [here](https://github.com/aenfield/mlb-watchability/issues/13).
