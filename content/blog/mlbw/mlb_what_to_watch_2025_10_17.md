Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Milwaukee Brewers @ Los Angeles Dodgers, 5:38p

### Summary

I need to search for more specific information about this particular game (Game 4) and the pitching matchup.Based on the search results, I can see this is NLCS Game 4 with the Dodgers leading 3-0. Let me write the summary now based on what I've learned.

**This NLCS Game 4 features Shohei Ohtani making his postseason pitching debut at Dodger Stadium with the Dodgers one win away from the World Series, delivering the highest gNERD score of the day at 14.74 and sitting well above the historical average.** Ohtani gets his first start since Game 1 of the NLDS, which will be "his postseason pitching debut at Dodger Stadium", and his pNERD of 12.49 ranks among the elite historically with an xFIP- of just 60 and 98 mph velocity. The defending champion Dodgers have jumped out to a 2-0 road advantage, and after Game 3, they're now up 3-0 and making Friday's Game 4 in L.A. a must-win if the Brewers want to prolong their season. The Brewers counter with 36-year-old Jose Quintana, whose -0.29 pNERD reflects an xFIP- of 119 and concerning swinging-strike and overall strike rates. Milwaukee brings the day's highest tNERD at 9.72, bolstered by strong baserunning and bullpen components, while the Dodgers' offensive prowess shows in their batting runs and barrel rate. The Brewers swept the six-game series against Los Angeles this year during the regular season, but the Dodgers' starting pitching has been lights-out as the Brewers' hitters looked overmatched through three playoff games. The pitching mismatch and elimination-game stakes make this compelling viewing.

## Toronto Blue Jays @ Seattle Mariners, 3:08p

### Summary

**This is Game 5 of the ALCS with the series tied 2-2, and the gNERD score of 11.46 sits right at the historical median while ranking as the lowest among today's playoff games.** The home team has yet to win a game in this series, creating an unusual dynamic as the Mariners look to buck that trend.

Kevin Gausman brings a solid 5.87 pNERD to the mound, bolstered by strong strike rate and swinging-strike numbers that translate to an xFIP- of 90. The 34-year-old veteran has the skills to navigate a high-leverage playoff start, though his slower pace drags down his watchability slightly. Bryce Miller's 4.24 pNERD tells a different story—his xFIP- of 110 indicates he's been pitching below league average, and his massive luck component of 1.00 suggests he's been fortunate to keep runs off the board relative to his peripherals. That regression could come due in a crucial elimination scenario.

Both teams feature strong offenses with batting runs well above average, though Toronto's superior fielding (1.61 z-score) contrasts sharply with Seattle's defensive struggles. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is batting .455 in the postseason with five home runs and has left the ballpark in back-to-back games, making him a focal point for watchability as the series shifts momentum.
