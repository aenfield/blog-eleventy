Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Milwaukee Brewers @ Los Angeles Dodgers, 5:38p

### Summary

Based on the search results, I can see this is **Game 4 of the NLCS on October 17, 2025**, with the Dodgers leading the series 3-0. The search results indicate that Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to start Game 4 as a pitcher (not TBD for Milwaukee - the Brewers haven't announced their starter). Let me write the summary:

**This is must-watch baseball: Shohei Ohtani makes his Dodger Stadium pitching debut in the postseason while the Brewers face elimination down 3-0 in the NLCS, and the gNERD score of 17.39 ranks as the highest among all games today and well into the 95th percentile historically.** The two-way superstar's return to the mound 13 days after his last start brings exceptional pitching metrics, with his pNERD of 12.49 leading all starters today thanks to elite velocity (98.1 mph) and a 60 xFIP- that ranks among the best.

The Brewers trail 2-0 in the series after Yoshinobu Yamamoto threw a complete game in Game 2, and the Dodgers won Game 3 with Tyler Glasnow allowing just one run in 5 ⅔ innings. Milwaukee's tNERD of 9.72 leads both teams today, driven by strong baserunning (2.12) and bullpen (1.13) components, though they haven't announced their starter, with everyone available except Freddy Peralta. The Dodgers' offense brings power with a 1.16 barrel rate component, while their 95.1 batting runs lead the way. Milwaukee swept the six-game regular season series, but the postseason has told a different story as Los Angeles sits one win from the World Series.

## Toronto Blue Jays @ Seattle Mariners, 3:08p

### Summary

**This is ALCS Game 5 with the series tied 2-2, and while the gNERD score of 11.46 sits below today's average, the stakes alone make this compelling.** The Mariners surged to an early 2-0 series lead, before the Blue Jays took over the show and won the next two, setting up a pivotal contest where the home team has yet to win a game in this series. 

Kevin Gausman brings a solid 5.87 pNERD to the mound, boosted by a strong 90 xFIP- and excellent strike rate that places him comfortably above the historical median. His 1.36 component from xFIP- reflects reliable effectiveness, though his slower pace drags down his overall score. Bryce Miller's 4.24 pNERD tells a different story—his 110 xFIP- translates to a -1.05 component, indicating below-average effectiveness. However, his substantial luck component of 1.00 suggests he's been getting hit harder than his peripherals would predict, meaning he's due for better results.

Toronto's offense has exploded in Seattle after managing just four runs in the first two games in Toronto, and their superior fielding (1.61 component) gives them an edge. Seattle counters with better barrel rate and a younger roster. Both teams feature strong batting runs components above 1.25, suggesting offense should be on display in this series-defining matchup.
