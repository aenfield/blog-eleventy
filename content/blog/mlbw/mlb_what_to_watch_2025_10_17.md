Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Milwaukee Brewers @ Los Angeles Dodgers, 5:38p

### Summary

**Shohei Ohtani on the mound with a sweep in reach is a pretty easy “yes” for your eyeballs. The Dodgers lead the NLCS 3–0 and hand Game 4 to Ohtani, while Milwaukee likely rides veteran Jose Quintana and hopes Jackson Chourio (cramp) is good to go.** 
At a gNERD of 14.74, this sits at the top of the slate and near the historic 95th percentile, and the reasons track: Ohtani’s top-shelf pNERD (12.49) and a 60 xFIP- scream bat-missing stuff, while Quintana’s pNERD (-0.29) and 119 xFIP- suggest the underdog needs soft contact and prayers. Milwaukee’s tNERD is the day’s high thanks to baserunning, defense, and a sturdy pen, but the Dodgers counter with barrel-fueled offense and a similarly strong bullpen. In this series, that pen has been nails and the Brewers’ bats have withered—three straight one-run outputs and just 10 total hits—so every Ohtani whiff will feel amplified. 
If you want star power plus elimination stakes, this is the watch: Ohtani’s velocity (near triple digits), the Dodgers’ power/pen edge, and Milwaukee’s chaos-on-the-bases recipe all collide—with Quintana’s craftiness left to keep it respectable long enough for someone in navy to finally square one up.

## Toronto Blue Jays @ Seattle Mariners, 3:08p

### Summary

**ALCS deadlock, Bryce Miller back on the bump with Bryan Woo lurking, and Kevin Gausman drawing the counterpunch: this is less a pitcher’s duel than a test of whose plan survives contact.** **Toronto’s bats just hung 21 runs in two games at T‑Mobile; Seattle’s answer is Miller—who won Game 1—while Woo, fresh off a pec strain, shifts to bullpen duty.** 

On the NERD front, this grades as the day’s floor gNERD (11.46) but still lands near the historic median, and the ingredients are classic: Gausman’s above‑average pNERD (5.87) rides a tidy xFIP- of 90, while Miller’s below‑average pNERD (4.24) and 110 xFIP- hint at more traffic and therefore more entertainment per pitch. Toronto’s higher tNERD (6.95) leans on elite gloves (big fielding runs), whereas Seattle brings real thump (better barrel rate), a contrast that usually produces watchable batted‑ball theater. With Anthony Santander off the roster and Joey Loperfido in, Toronto mixes power with platoon shuffles; Seattle, tied 2‑2 in the series, trusts Miller again after his six efficient innings in the opener and prepares Woo as a fireman. Gausman, meanwhile, was a hard‑luck loser in Game 1 and returns on script. If you like strategy layered over stuff, this rates better than its modest gNERD suggests.
