Here are today's MLB games, ordered by watchability, based on how interesting the teams and starting pitchers look. Higher is better.

This is inspired by [Carson Cistulli's NERD scores](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/introducing-team-nerd/) at FanGraphs. (I'll write a bit about the details of [my implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/aenfield/mlb-watchability) soon, and then link to that from this intro.)

Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I might also show 'no data' when I'm not correctly linking the schedule information with a pitcher's stats, like if the names don't match (I have an open issue to improve this).


# Detail

## Chicago Cubs @ Milwaukee Brewers, 7:40p

### Summary

The Cubs-Brewers matchup presents a fascinating contrast between veteran excellence and rookie brilliance that makes it exceptionally watchable. Boyd, 34, is having the best season of his career in his first year with the Cubs, as he has a 2.20 ERA, 3.10 FIP, and 108 strikeouts over 118 2⁄3 innings. He's just one strikeout away from 1,000 for his career. His pNERD of 5.59 undersells what's been a remarkable comeback campaign, especially considering he has a 0.67 ERA in four July starts. The Cubs' tNERD of 9.47 reflects their well-rounded excellence, with strong offensive metrics (batting runs z-score of 1.56) and solid fielding.

But the real story is Misiorowski, whose 12.28 pNERD is backed by genuinely jaw-dropping numbers. Misiorowski has been nothing short of great to begin his career, with just eight runs allowed (five of which came in a single outing) across 29 1⁄3 innings while striking out 40. The 23-year-old's meteoric rise culminated in being named to the National League All-Star team as a replacement for Chicago Cubs pitcher Matthew Boyd, Major League Baseball announced in a Friday night shocker. Misiorowski, 23, is the fastest player ever to make an MLB All-Star Game by number of games played. His 99.4 mph velocity (z-score of 2.60) and elite swinging strike rate make him appointment viewing.

**This NL Central showdown between tied teams features a career-year veteran chasing 1,000 strikeouts against a rookie phenom who just made All-Star history in his first month, creating must-see theater with legitimate division implications.**

## Los Angeles Dodgers @ Cincinnati Reds, 7:10p

### Summary

This Dodgers-Reds matchup features a compelling contrast between rookie Chase Burns, the second-overall pick in the 2024 draft making his sixth major league start, who has struck out 35 percent of his batters faced, including 10 strikeouts in each of his last two starts but allowed six runs in his last start and seven runs in another, and has a 6.65 ERA thus far. His pNERD of 12.39 reflects his elite swing-and-miss ability (98.2 mph velocity, excellent SwStr%) despite the early career volatility. On the other side, Yamamoto has put up a 2.55 ERA and 10.2 strikeouts per nine innings across 20 games this season, while giving up a batting average of .197 to his opponents and enters this outing with 11 quality starts under his belt this year. The Dodgers' massive payroll advantage ($341M vs $115.7M) translates to superior offensive firepower, with their 6.23 tNERD driven by strong batting runs and barrel rate metrics. The Reds swept the Dodgers in Cincinnati last season and won the season series against Los Angeles, four games to three, adding historical intrigue to this opener. Burns' extreme inconsistency paired with his dominant strikeout potential creates the kind of high-variance entertainment that makes games unpredictable, while Yamamoto's steady excellence provides a fascinating contrast in approaches. **This game offers the perfect recipe for watchability: a proven ace facing off against a wildly talented but erratic rookie phenom, with the potential for either a pitcher's duel or an offensive explosion depending on which version of Burns shows up.**

## Tampa Bay Rays @ New York Yankees, 7:05p

### Summary

The absence of Aaron Judge from the Yankees lineup adds intrigue to a matchup that features Drew Rasmussen's stellar 2.93 ERA against Cam Schlittler making just his third career start with a 4.35 ERA. Rasmussen brings legitimate quality to the mound with his 6.59 pNERD, supported by a 6-1 record with 2.60 ERA over his past 12 starts and a dominant 0.34 ERA in five career appearances against the Yankees. The Yankees' offensive firepower remains formidable even without Judge, as evidenced by their 8.11 tNERD driven by exceptional batting runs and barrel rate metrics that dwarf Tampa Bay's more modest offensive production. The Rays enter riding a seven-game road slide, though their solid baserunning component provides some entertainment value. Schlittler's outing could serve as an audition for a potential trade, adding another layer of significance to his performance against a pitcher who has historically dominated his team. **This game offers the compelling narrative of a proven pitcher in Rasmussen facing a Yankees offense missing its biggest star, while the rookie Schlittler tries to prove his worth in what amounts to a high-stakes evaluation.**

## New York Mets @ San Diego Padres, 9:40p

### Summary

The Mets-Padres matchup presents a fascinating study in contrasts that drives the solid 12.52 gNERD score. The Mets arrive riding a seven-game winning streak, playing some of the best baseball in the major leagues, while the Padres hold a 57-49 record and are four games back in the NL West. Dylan Cease's impressive 8.24 pNERD makes him the clear draw here - he's posted 144 strikeouts in 113.2 innings with a strong 29.6 percent strikeout rate, though he's not pitching all that well despite the gaudy K numbers, with home runs being a problem at 1.27 per nine. Frankie Montas, making just his sixth start since joining the Mets well into the season, has been better in his last two outings, allowing three earned runs over 10.2 innings, though his overall 5.42 pNERD reflects middling results.

The Mets' offensive firepower drives their stellar 8.87 tNERD, with their impressive barrel rate z-score of 1.45 translating to real production from Juan Soto's 25 home runs and Pete Alonso's 22 homers and power presence. Meanwhile, the Padres' anemic 2.52 tNERD reflects their -1.24 barrel rate z-score, though Manny Machado went 4-for-5 with 3 RBIs in their recent 9-2 win, while Fernando Tatis Jr. contributed 2 hits and 3 runs. Adding intrigue, Cease's name has come up in trade rumors involving the Mets, creating an awkward subplot. **This game offers the compelling combination of a hot team with superior offensive metrics facing a quality strikeout pitcher whose trade value might be on display, making it a worthwhile watch despite the Padres' offensive struggles.**

## Atlanta Braves @ Kansas City Royals, 7:40p

### Summary

This matchup offers a fascinating study in contrasts between a high-octane young ace trying to recapture his dominance and a crafty veteran defying Father Time. Spencer Strider (4-8, 3.72 ERA) brings an impressive 89 strikeouts in 72.2 innings and a monstrous 7.83 pNERD score that reflects his elite swing-and-miss stuff, particularly his 95.6 mph fastball velocity and otherworldly swinging strike rate. However, Strider has allowed three runs in three of his last four starts, including giving up two home runs while yielding three other hits and three walks against San Francisco, and he's openly frustrated with his inconsistency after missing most of 2024 recovering from Tommy John surgery.

The intrigue deepens with 45-year-old Rich Hill making just his second start since signing with Kansas City, his 14th MLB team. Hill has never suffered a losing decision against Atlanta, though his 0.00 pNERD reflects minimal recent data. The Braves enter on a five-game skid with all five members of their Opening Day rotation on the injured list, while Kansas City ranks 29th in runs scored but boasts the second-best team ERA in baseball. The Braves' superior fielding and luck metrics suggest they're better than their 44-60 record indicates, but their offensive struggles (-66.8 batting runs for Kansas City, -12.7 for Atlanta) could make this a pitcher's duel. **This game's 12.24 gNERD score is driven almost entirely by Strider's elite strikeout potential, making it a must-watch for fans who appreciate dominant pitching performances, even if the offensive fireworks may be limited.**

## Miami Marlins @ St. Louis Cardinals, 7:45p

### Summary

With a decent gNERD score of 11.46, this Marlins-Cardinals matchup offers moderate entertainment value despite both teams being more or less out of contention. Edward Cabrera emerges as the clear draw with his impressive 7.33 pNERD, fueled by electric 96.7 mph velocity and solid xFIP metrics, while being the subject of much speculation as the trade deadline nears. The right-hander has been dealing lately, allowing two runs or fewer in three of his past four starts in July and striking out six and walking none in his most recent victory over San Diego. Meanwhile, Andre Pallante's struggles create an intriguing contrast - his 4.63 pNERD reflects recent woes as he's allowed 18 runs (17 earned) on 25 hits and five walks in 15 2/3 innings over his last three starts. The Cardinals desperately need a turnaround after losing seven of their last 10 games while losing ground in the National League wild-card race, while Miami enters riding momentum with a 6-3 record since the All-Star break. **This game presents a classic pitcher-versus-pitcher narrative with Cabrera's rising stock against Pallante's recent struggles, making it a compelling watch for those who appreciate pitching duels with potential trade deadline implications.**

## Arizona Diamondbacks @ Detroit Tigers, 6:40p

### Summary

This game features a fascinating clash of extremes that should provide plenty of entertainment for the analytically inclined viewer. Detroit turns to rookie Troy Melton to start this game. Melton has only pitched five innings in MLB and has a 10.80 ERA. The right-hander's zero pNERD score reflects his complete lack of MLB track record, making him essentially a wild card who could either implode spectacularly or surprise everyone. His most recent appearance came on Wednesday against the Pittsburgh Pirates, when the right-hander tossed five innings, surrendering six earned runs while allowing seven hits. In one appearance this season, he has a 10.80 ERA and 12.6 strikeouts per nine innings, while opponents are hitting .333 against him.

On the other side, Rodriguez is a former Tiger who is struggling this year. Despite his modest 3.48 pNERD, Rodriguez brings veteran savvy and The left-hander's last start was on Wednesday, when he tossed 6 1/3 innings without allowing a run on six hits in a matchup with the Houston Astros. The team dynamics add intrigue too: The Detroit Tigers have been slumping hard since before the All-Star break and continued their losing ways against the Toronto Blue Jays at home this weekend, dropping the series three games to one. Meanwhile, 'Zona comes in having split its last 10 games, but has just one win in its last six matchups — a 1-0 road win at the Pittsburgh Pirates, dropping them to fourth in the National League West and 10 games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.

**This matchup offers the perfect storm of rookie volatility, veteran intrigue, and two teams desperately needing to break out of their respective funks, making it a compelling watch despite the modest overall gNERD score.**

## Philadelphia Phillies @ Chicago White Sox, 7:40p

### Summary

This matchup presents a delicious mismatch that should have baseball purists salivating. Cristopher Sánchez has been throwing darts with a 2.40 ERA and 134 strikeouts through 124 2/3 innings, sporting an elite xFIP- of 68 that makes him one of the most effective left-handers in baseball right now. In his last start, Sanchez pitched a complete game, giving up four hits and one run in nine innings, while striking out 12 batters, and he's 3-0 with a 1.19 ERA in four July starts and has pitched at least six innings in nine straight starts. His pNERD of 9.59 reflects this dominance perfectly, with exceptional swinging strike rates and velocity that make him appointment viewing.

On the other side, you have Davis Martin and the historically awful White Sox, who are 38-68 and 22 games back in the AL Central. Martin's 3.34 pNERD tells the story of a pitcher struggling with below-average metrics across the board, while the White Sox have scored just 394 runs (3.8 per game) and have a team batting average of .226, ranking 27th and 29th respectively. The Phillies' superior offensive depth, led by Kyle Schwarber's 36 home runs, creates a stark contrast against Chicago's anemic attack. **This game offers the rare pleasure of watching a genuinely elite pitcher dominate one of baseball's most overmatched lineups, making it essential viewing for anyone who appreciates pitching artistry against overwhelming odds.**

## Texas Rangers @ Los Angeles Angels, 9:38p

### Summary

The Angels-Rangers matchup presents a fascinating study in contrasts, anchored by Jacob deGrom's dominant 10-2 record and 2.28 ERA against Jack Kochanowicz making his first start of the season and first appearance in over a year. The 37-year-old deGrom continues his remarkable career resurgence with elite velocity and strikeout rates that earned him a stellar 10.19 pNERD, while the 24-year-old Kochanowicz represents a complete unknown quantity for the Angels. This David-versus-Goliath pitching matchup creates immediate intrigue, especially considering deGrom has allowed just 81 hits over 118.1 innings while maintaining his signature dominance. The Rangers' superior tNERD of 5.78 reflects their better baserunning and fielding despite offensive struggles, while the Angels' 2.72 tNERD is dragged down by historically poor fielding metrics. The massive gap in pitcher quality creates a compelling narrative of whether Kochanowicz can somehow neutralize the Rangers' momentum or if deGrom will simply overpower a middling Angels lineup. **This game offers the rare combination of watching a future Hall of Famer potentially dominate against a complete wild card, making it essential viewing for those who appreciate elite pitching performances and unpredictable outcomes.**

## Washington Nationals @ Houston Astros, 8:10p

### Summary

This matchup offers solid watchability potential with a gNERD of 10.46, driven primarily by the pitching talent on display. Framber Valdez is the Astros' ace with an impressive 11-4 record with a 2.67 ERA and 129 strikeouts, and his pNERD of 7.15 reflects his excellence with a stellar xFIP- of 73 that places him well above average. The left-hander has quietly pieced together one of the most impressive runs in baseball, going 10-0 with a 1.86 ERA over his last 13 starts with Houston winning all 13 of those games. His opposing starter Brad Lord carries a respectable 6.63 pNERD despite his modest 2-5 record, suggesting better underlying metrics than his win-loss tally indicates.

The storylines add intrigue beyond the numbers. The Astros were embarrassed over the weekend, swept by the Athletics in a three-game series and were outscored 27-5, creating a bounce-back narrative for the home team. After being swept at home by the Oakland Athletics — their third home sweep of the season — Houston finds itself in unfamiliar territory, having lost nine of its last ten at home. Meanwhile, the Nationals took two of three against the Twins in Minneapolis outscoring Minnesota 16-6, suggesting they might not be the pushover their 43-62 record implies.

The team metrics tell a tale of contrasts: Houston's superior tNERD of 4.66 versus Washington's pedestrian 2.47 reflects the Astros' advantages in batting runs, fielding, and payroll, though both teams struggle with barrel rate. **With Valdez's dominant recent form anchoring a solid pitching matchup and Houston desperately needing to end their home struggles against a surprisingly frisky Nationals squad, this game delivers enough compelling elements to justify its above-average watchability score.**

## Seattle Mariners @ Athletics, 10:05p

### Summary

This matchup presents an intriguing contrast in form and fortune between two AL West rivals. The Athletics completed a sweep of the Houston Astros Sunday with a 7-1 win, outscoring the Astros 27-5 over the three games, riding a four-game winning streak into this series opener. Meanwhile, Seattle lost Sunday, 4-1, to split their four-game series against the Angels despite Cal Raleigh smacking his 41st home run of the season.

The pitching matchup favors Seattle significantly, with Luis Castillo's solid 5.43 pNERD score anchored by his impressive velocity (95.2 mph) and veteran presence at age 32. Castillo brings a 7-6 record with a 3.30 ERA and 107 strikeouts, though he gave up three earned runs and allowed 10 hits in five innings pitched against the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday. On the other side, JP Sears presents a stark contrast with his paltry 1.03 pNERD, hampered by poor swinging strike rates and slower velocity at 92.0 mph, despite a strong last outing against Texas with just 1 earned run allowed.

The Athletics' surprising 7.81 tNERD benefits heavily from exceptional luck metrics (z-score of 1.93), while Seattle's more modest 5.52 tNERD reflects their superior talent but recent struggles. Shea Langeliers has blasted homers in three straight games for Oakland, while Cal Raleigh has a two-game home run streak of his own for Seattle, setting up potential fireworks despite the pitching disparity.

**This game offers solid watchability driven primarily by Castillo's strong pitching performance potential against an Athletics team riding momentum, though the significant talent gap suggests Seattle should control proceedings despite Oakland's recent hot streak.**

## Boston Red Sox @ Minnesota Twins, 7:40p

### Summary

The Red Sox-Twins matchup presents a fascinating study in contrasts, with Richard Fitts (1-4, 4.86 ERA) facing Simeon Woods Richardson (5-4, 4.14 ERA). Despite Fitts' modest 1-4 record and concerning 4.86 ERA, his pNERD score of 7.01 tells a different story, driven by an impressive 95.6 mph velocity and strong strike rate that suggests better days ahead. The 25-year-old has history with Minnesota too, having pitched five scoreless innings against the Twins last September, though he's coming off a rough outing where he gave up four earned runs in 3 1/3 innings against Philadelphia. On the other side, Woods Richardson's pedestrian 1.98 pNERD reflects his struggles with command, particularly evident in his last start where he went just three innings, allowing three runs on two hits and five walks despite the Twins winning. The 24-year-old's xFIP- of 122 suggests his 4.14 ERA might actually be flattering his true performance. Boston's superior offense, ranking ninth-best in MLB with a .251 team average, should capitalize against a pitcher who's facing the Red Sox for the first time. **This game's 9.64 gNERD score stems largely from the pitching mismatch favoring Boston and the Red Sox's well-rounded offensive attack, making it a compelling watch despite both starters' recent struggles.**

## Toronto Blue Jays @ Baltimore Orioles, 6:35p

### Summary

This Blue Jays-Orioles matchup presents a fascinating study in contrasts, with Toronto facing the team with the best record in the majors against Baltimore, who trail by 15 1/2 games in the American League East. The gNERD score of 9.18 reflects this disparity, driven primarily by Toronto's exceptional tNERD of 6.91 versus Baltimore's pedestrian 2.70. The Blue Jays' superior fielding runs (34.1, z-score 1.91) and batting runs (42.3, z-score 0.89) showcase a well-rounded team that's 8-2 since the All-Star break, while Baltimore's struggling defense (-18.9 fielding runs) has contributed to their 4-6 post-break record.

Chris Bassitt's solid pNERD of 4.88 reflects his excellent July form, going 4-0 across four starts this month with a 2.39 ERA. The 36-year-old veteran's age (z-score 1.90) and deliberate pace (20.4s, z-score 1.53) add character to his profile, though his below-average velocity (91.5 mph) suggests he relies on craft over power. Zach Eflin's return from nearly a month on the IL with low back discomfort, limiting Cleveland to two hits and two runs over five innings last week, provides intrigue despite his elevated 5.78 ERA and modest pNERD of 3.86.

The supporting cast adds depth to the entertainment value, with Bo Bichette coming off a five-hit game on Sunday and catcher Alejandro Kirk's concussion creating roster uncertainty for Toronto. **With Toronto's offensive firepower meeting Baltimore's defensive struggles while both teams navigate trade deadline uncertainty, this game offers compelling theater between a contender and a disappointing underachiever, making it surprisingly watchable despite the talent gap.**

## Pittsburgh Pirates @ San Francisco Giants, 9:45p

### Summary

This game presents a fascinating study in contrasts that makes it surprisingly watchable despite the modest 6.39 gNERD score. Carson Whisenhunt is making his MLB debut for the Giants, a 24-year-old left-hander who's been solid at Triple-A Sacramento with an 8-5 record and 4.42 ERA in 97 2/3 innings. His zero pNERD reflects the uncertainty inherent in any debut, creating immediate intrigue for viewers who love witnessing first-time big leaguers.

Meanwhile, Mitch Keller has been red-hot lately, going 3-1 with a 2.32 ERA in his last seven starts after a dismal 1-9 start to the season. The 29-year-old has held opponents to three or fewer runs in 18 of 21 starts, including eight consecutive such outings with a 2.59 ERA. His solid 4.20 pNERD reflects this consistency, though his 18.7% strikeout rate is the second-lowest of his career, explaining his underwhelming SwStr% in the data.

The Pirates arrive riding momentum from consecutive wins, including a 6-0 shutout of Arizona, while the Giants are reeling from being swept by the Mets and going 0-for-23 with runners in scoring position in that series. This could be Keller's final start as a Pirate, adding trade deadline drama to an already compelling matchup.

**A rookie debut against a resurgent pitcher on the trade block, with one team surging and another struggling offensively, creates more entertainment value than the modest NERD scores suggest.**

## Colorado Rockies @ Cleveland Guardians, 6:40p

### Summary

This matchup pits two teams heading in opposite directions, with the Guardians sitting at .500 (52-52) while the Rockies languish at a dismal 27-77. The gNERD score of 6.25 suggests moderate watchability, driven primarily by Cleveland's solid fundamentals rather than offensive fireworks. The Guardians' pitching staff ranks 13th in strikeouts per nine innings (8.5) with a respectable 3.93 ERA ranking 16th league-wide, while Colorado's pitching is historically awful, averaging just 8.5 strikeouts per nine innings (worst in MLB) with a ghastly 5.62 ERA ranking dead last. The real intrigue comes from the pitching matchup, where Slade Cecconi's impressive 4.85 pNERD reflects his solid 3.76 ERA and reliable strike-throwing ability, contrasting sharply with Bradley Blalock's concerning 0.57 pNERD driven by an alarming 131 xFIP- that suggests he's been getting extremely lucky. Colorado's offense provides little help, ranking 28th in runs scored (3.6 per game), 24th in batting average (.234), and striking out 9.7 times per game. The Guardians are massive -240 favorites, and with key Rockies players like German Marquez and Kris Bryant on the injured list, this shapes up as a potential blowout. **While Cecconi's steady presence makes this moderately watchable, Blalock's inevitable regression combined with Colorado's offensive futility suggests you might want to find a more competitive game unless you enjoy watching batting practice.**
