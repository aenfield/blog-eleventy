Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Los Angeles Dodgers @ Milwaukee Brewers, 5:08p

### Summary

**This NLCS Game 2 matchup delivers elite pitching and a compelling revenge narrative, as the Brewers—who swept the Dodgers 6-0 in the regular season—try to defend home court against the reigning World Series champions.** The 15.74 gNERD score sits well above the historical 95th percentile of 14.76, driven by strong contributions from both teams and starting pitchers.

Yamamoto has been part of a "dynamic starting rotation" for the Dodgers in these playoffs, and his 8.89 pNERD reflects that quality with an excellent 74 xFIP- and strong swinging strike rate. Peralta anchors the Brewers' staff with a solid 5.29 pNERD, posting a 93 xFIP- and generating plenty of whiffs himself. Milwaukee's 9.71 tNERD leads this matchup thanks to outstanding baserunning (2.12 component) and strong bullpen work, while the Dodgers counter with superior batting (1.33) and barrel rate (1.16). The Dodgers are "bidding to return to the World Series and become the first team in a quarter century to successfully defend their title," adding stakes to what's already a high-quality pitching duel between two well-rounded clubs.
