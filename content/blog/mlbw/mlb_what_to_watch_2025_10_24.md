Here are today's MLB games, ordered by watchability, based on how interesting the teams and starting pitchers look. Higher is better. For more information, [read this post](https://andrewenfield.com/blog/2025/08/07/how-to-choose-which-baseball-game-to-watch).

Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Los Angeles Dodgers @ Toronto Blue Jays, 5:00p

### Summary

**A rookie making World Series history meets a two-time Cy who’s currently erasing hitters; that’s a pretty good reason to watch. gNERD 13.90 agrees, pitting Blake Snell’s peak form against Trey Yesavage’s audacious Game 1 assignment.** 

Snell’s strong pNERD (8.26) isn’t theoretical: he carved eight scoreless with 10 strikeouts in the NLCS opener and has allowed two runs total across three postseason starts, the sort of dominance that makes even patient lineups swing first and ask questions later.  Yesavage shows a pNERD of 0 only because the model lacks MLB sample; his résumé is anything but empty—5⅓ hitless innings with 11 K in his ALDS debut—and he becomes the second‑youngest pitcher ever to start a World Series Game 1, trailing only Ralph Branca. 

Under the hood, Dodgers tNERD (7.59) leans on real thunder (strong batting runs and barrels) plus a top bullpen, while Toronto’s tNERD (6.95) is buoyed by elite fielding despite softer contact quality and shaky baserunning. That means power-and-‘pen versus gloves-and-gumption, layered over the novelty of a 22‑year‑old splitter artist facing a changeup‑happy ace. If you like watchability defined by dominance versus discovery, this is it.
