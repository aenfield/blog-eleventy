Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Los Angeles Dodgers @ Toronto Blue Jays, 5:00p

### Summary

**High stakes, high octane: Toronto tries to finish a 3-2 series behind Kevin Gausman while Yoshinobu Yamamoto, fresh off a historic CG, aims to drag this thing to the limit.** **With a gNERD of 14.65—top among today’s slate and brushing the 95th percentile historically—this is appointment baseball, not background noise.** 

The model likes this because the pitching carries real bite: Yamamoto’s pNERD (8.89) dwarfs Gausman’s (5.87), backed by a sharper xFIP- (74 vs. 90) and better bat-missing, plus the tantalizing note that he just threw the first World Series complete game since 2015 and could stack another.  Off the field-tilt, Toronto holds the hammer, starting Gausman at home with the champagne on ice, but L.A. has hinted at creative urgency—including a just-in-case Ohtani relief cameo—which only heightens the drama.  The contrasting team profiles fit the eye test: Dodgers bring barrels and a sturdy pen, Jays counter with elite gloves and, lately, timely thunder, as Game 5’s rookie K record and lightning-strike opening homers reminded everyone.  And yes, it’s Yamamoto–Gausman again, a clean narrative loop for Game 6.
