Here are today's MLB games, ordered by watchability, based on how interesting the teams and starting pitchers look. Higher is better.

This is inspired by [Carson Cistulli's NERD scores](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/introducing-team-nerd/) at FanGraphs. (I'll write a bit about the details of [my implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/aenfield/mlb-watchability) soon, and then link to that from this intro.)

Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I might also show 'no data' when I'm not correctly linking the schedule information with a pitcher's stats, like if the names don't match (I have an open issue to improve this).


# Detail

## Boston Red Sox @ Minnesota Twins, 1:10p

### Summary

**This game offers compelling theater with a young Twins pitcher whose exceptional stats suggest he's due for a breakout performance against a Red Sox team that's quietly surging toward a wild card spot.** The series finale between these evenly matched clubs features one of the most intriguing pitcher-versus-team dynamics you'll see, making it a solid watch despite a middling overall gNERD score.

Zebby Matthews takes the mound for his seventh start with a 4.97 ERA and 38 strikeouts in 29⅔ innings, but his stellar pNERD score of 11.98 tells a different story. His underlying metrics are outstanding - particularly his 69 xFIP- that ranks in the 91st percentile, suggesting significant positive regression is coming. The 25-year-old throws hard at 96.7 mph and works quickly, contributing to his exceptional watchability score that ranks among the day's highest.

Meanwhile, Brayan Bello comes off consecutive losses to the Cubs and Dodgers but has maintained solid underlying performance with a 3.32 ERA. His modest pNERD of 3.51 reflects some concerning strikeout and command issues, creating an interesting contrast with Matthews' upside potential.

The Red Sox moved ahead of the Mariners for the second wild card spot with Tuesday's win and could improve to 19-15-1 in series play, adding meaningful stakes to what could be a pitcher's duel with breakout potential. Matthews is coming off perhaps his best start when he held the Nationals scoreless through six innings, suggesting the statistical regression may already be beginning.

## Texas Rangers @ Los Angeles Angels, 9:38p

### Summary

**This matchup pits Nathan Eovaldi's dominant season against a surging Angels team in what shapes up as a compelling pitching duel with offensive upside.** The game's gNERD score of 12.61 sits comfortably above today's average of 9.83 and approaches the upper tier of historical games, driven primarily by strong pitcher performances on both sides.

Eovaldi enters with an exceptional 1.50 ERA through 17 starts, and his pNERD of 8.70 reflects elite performance metrics, particularly his outstanding xFIP- of 67 that translates to strong run prevention ability. The 35-year-old veteran brings both velocity and control, though his slightly slower pace works against his entertainment value. Soriano counters with a respectable 3.79 ERA and 108 strikeouts in 126⅔ innings, and his pNERD of 7.99 benefits from higher velocity at 97.2 mph and his relative youth at 26.

The team dynamics add intrigue beyond the pitching matchup. The Angels have won the first two games of this series and three straight overall, while the Rangers' superior baserunning (1.93 component score) contrasts sharply with the Angels' poor fielding (-2.18). However, Los Angeles compensates with strong barrel rate production (1.86), suggesting potential for offensive fireworks despite both pitchers' quality.

The season series stands at 5-4 in favor of Texas, and Corey Seager has tormented Angels pitching with a .447 average and five homers over his last 13 games against them. With both teams hovering around .500 and playoff implications still in play, this series finale offers the kind of competitive balance that makes for engaging late-season baseball.

## Chicago Cubs @ Milwaukee Brewers, 2:10p

### Summary

**This Cubs-Brewers finale offers a solid but not spectacular pitching matchup with meaningful NL Central stakes that elevate its watchability beyond what the middling gNERD score suggests.**

The Cubs face elimination from first place as they trail Milwaukee by two games heading into this series finale, with Shota Imanaga (7-4, 3.12 ERA) opposing Freddy Peralta (12-4, 2.81 ERA). The 12.15 gNERD score ranks above today's average of 9.83 and sits comfortably in the upper third of the historical range, driven primarily by Chicago's strong team metrics rather than exceptional pitching numbers. The Cubs' 9.51 tNERD represents the day's highest team score, powered by solid contributions across batting runs (1.56), baserunning (1.49), and fielding (1.31). Milwaukee's more modest 7.86 tNERD still benefits from excellent baserunning (2.28) and gets a boost from their younger roster composition.

Peralta enters with momentum from his recent hot streak, going 6-0 over his last seven starts, while his 4.61 pNERD reflects decent strikeout ability balanced against some control issues. Imanaga's last outing was disastrous, allowing seven runs on 12 hits in just three innings against the White Sox, though his 2.32 pNERD suggests underlying skills remain intact despite that blowup. The Cubs starter has struggled specifically against Milwaukee, losing both career starts while allowing nine runs in 10 innings. The divisional implications and Peralta's strikeout upside make this a worthwhile watch despite neither pitcher posting elite NERD numbers.

## Tampa Bay Rays @ New York Yankees, 7:05p

### Summary

**This game offers solid watchability with a gNERD score well above average, driven by the Yankees' explosive offensive potential and two pitchers whose contrasting profiles set up compelling strategic battles.** The absence of Aaron Judge creates both opportunity and uncertainty that could swing the game's entertainment value in either direction.

With a gNERD of 11.66, this matchup ranks in the upper tier of today's games and sits comfortably above historical averages. The Yankees are dealing with significant injuries, most notably Aaron Judge on the IL with a flexor strain, which removes their most dangerous offensive weapon but creates more unpredictable lineup dynamics. Will Warren brings a 6-5 record with a 4.82 ERA and 124 strikeouts in 104⅔ innings, while Zack Littell counters with an 8-8 mark and 3.72 ERA.

The Yankees' offensive firepower drives their strong 7.55 tNERD, with exceptional barrel rate and batting runs components that suggest they can generate runs even without Judge. Warren's 5.51 pNERD benefits from his strong xFIP- performance and youth factor, though he struggles with putting hitters away, often working deep counts that limit his innings. Littell presents an intriguing contrast with his historically low 16.5% strikeout rate but excellent 3% walk rate, creating a pitcher who avoids free passes but may be vulnerable to sustained offensive pressure.

The Rays have had success against Warren previously, scoring seven hits and three runs in four innings during their last encounter, while Littell is coming off a rough outing where he allowed five runs in six innings against Cincinnati. The strategic chess match between Tampa Bay's contact-oriented approach and New York's power-heavy lineup, combined with both pitchers' recent inconsistencies, should produce the kind of competitive, run-scoring environment that makes for entertaining baseball.

## Seattle Mariners @ Athletics, 10:05p

### Summary

**This matchup features a strong pitching performance differential that should create solid entertainment value, with Bryan Woo's impressive form contrasting sharply against Jeffrey Springs' struggles.** The 11.37 gNERD score sits comfortably above today's average of 9.83 and well into the upper third of typical ranges.

Bryan Woo brings legitimate ace potential to the mound with his 8-5 record and 2.91 ERA through 126.2 innings, backed by a stellar 7.49 pNERD score that ranks among today's best pitcher performances. The Oakland native has dominated his hometown Athletics with a 3-0 record and 0.89 ERA in four career starts against them, making this a particularly compelling individual storyline. His 95.5 mph velocity and strong strike-throwing ability contribute to his watchability factor.

On the other side, Jeffrey Springs enters with a pedestrian 9-7 record and 4.13 ERA, reflected in his weak 2.11 pNERD score. The significant luck component (1.96) in Oakland's team metrics suggests they've been playing better than their underlying numbers indicate, which could lead to regression. Interestingly, Springs has posted a 1.64 ERA in two previous starts against Seattle this season, while Woo registered a 4.50 ERA against Oakland, creating an intriguing reverse narrative to their season-long performance levels.

Cal Raleigh's 41 home runs lead Seattle's offense, while the Athletics counter with decent power from multiple sources. The Mariners' superior record (57-50 vs 46-63) and playoff positioning add stakes to this late-July contest.

## Arizona Diamondbacks @ Detroit Tigers, 1:10p

### Summary

**This matchup features two teams heading in opposite directions, with Detroit riding a three-game win streak while Arizona desperately tries to halt a four-game skid that has knocked them out of playoff contention.** The gNERD score of 11.09 sits comfortably above today's average and historical norms, making this a solid viewing choice despite some underlying concerns.

Chris Paddack makes his Tigers debut after being acquired from Minnesota on Monday, replacing injured starter Reese Olson in Detroit's rotation. Paddack's 4.95 ERA and recent struggles (11 runs allowed in his last 10 innings) suggest the trade-deadline pickup has work to do, reflected in his modest 2.53 pNERD score. His poor xFIP- component (-1.24) indicates underlying performance issues that won't magically disappear with a uniform change.

Ryne Nelson enters with four quality starts in his last five outings, allowing just one run across his previous 12 innings. His 3.68 pNERD score benefits from solid velocity (95.5 mph) but suffers from concerning swing-and-miss rates. The Diamondbacks desperately need Nelson to continue his recent form as they've fallen to 51-57 and dropped out of playoff contention.

Detroit's superior team metrics shine through their 8.64 tNERD score, particularly strong baserunning (1.13 component) and their young roster (1.14 age component). The Tigers have won three straight, including Tuesday's 12-2 demolition featuring 11 extra-base hits. Arizona's offense faces pressure to respond after managing just two runs in that blowout loss.

The contrasting trajectories and Paddack's debut storyline provide enough intrigue to justify the above-average gNERD rating, even if neither pitcher profiles as dominant.

## Pittsburgh Pirates @ San Francisco Giants, 3:45p

### Summary

**This matchup offers solid pitching entertainment with Logan Webb's high-quality stuff against Mike Burrows' improving form, but the overall watchability remains middling due to the Pirates' offensive struggles and the Giants' recent collapse.**

With a gNERD of 10.15, this game sits slightly above today's average of 9.83 but well within the typical range. The real draw comes from Logan Webb's exceptional 9.36 pNERD, driven by his outstanding xFIP- of 68 that places him among the league's elite pitchers. Webb enters with a 3.38 ERA and 144 strikeouts, though he has allowed 10 runs in 10 innings since the All-Star break. His fast pace (16.4 seconds) adds to the viewing experience, making games move briskly.

Mike Burrows presents an intriguing counterpoint with his 6.39 pNERD bolstered by solid velocity (95.3 mph) and quick pace. The 25-year-old right-hander didn't allow a run in six innings in his last outing against Arizona, suggesting he's finding his rhythm despite his 1-3 record.

The Pirates arrive riding a four-game winning streak and seeking a sweep, while the Giants face their first sub-.500 record of the season with a loss. Former Giants players Andrew McCutchen and Joey Bart have been the offensive heroes for Pittsburgh in this series, adding a compelling narrative thread to an otherwise straightforward pitching duel.

## Atlanta Braves @ Kansas City Royals, 2:10p

### Summary

**This game offers decent watchability despite featuring two struggling teams, largely thanks to Angel Zerpa's strong pitching metrics and a significant mismatch in the starting rotation.** The Royals' lefty brings impressive skill-based numbers that suggest he's been unlucky, while Joey Wentz has struggled mightily since joining Atlanta.

With a gNERD score of 9.47 sitting just below today's average of 9.83, this matchup provides moderate entertainment value. Wentz has been excellent in limited action for Atlanta with a 14/3 strikeout-to-walk ratio, though his pNERD of 1.72 ranks among the lowest today, reflecting his poor underlying metrics. Meanwhile, Zerpa's 7.95 pNERD stands well above today's average of 4.70, driven by his excellent xFIP- of 79 and strong velocity at 96.4 mph.

The Braves will be without Ronald Acuña Jr., who landed on the IL with Achilles tightness, further tilting the field toward Kansas City. The Royals enter as series-deciding favorites, having won game two 9-6 behind solid pitching from Seth Lugo. Both teams show significant luck components in their tNERD scores, suggesting they've underperformed their talent, but Atlanta's superior fielding (0.87 component) provides some balance against Kansas City's offensive struggles.

Bobby Witt Jr. has been particularly devastating against left-handed pitching like Wentz, posting a .342 average and .632 slugging percentage, making him a focal point for entertainment. The pitching disparity and lineup changes create enough intrigue to justify watching, even if neither team is particularly compelling overall.

## Washington Nationals @ Houston Astros, 2:10p

### Summary

**This game offers a compelling pitching duel with MacKenzie Gore showcasing elite stuff against a Houston lineup that just broke out of an offensive funk.** The 9.04 gNERD score sits below today's average but provides solid entertainment value, driven primarily by Gore's impressive 7.38 pNERD.

Gore enters with a 4-10 record and 3.52 ERA, but his recent struggles include allowing eight runs in just 2.1 innings in his first post-All-Star start, making his bounce-back attempt particularly intriguing. His advanced metrics paint a much rosier picture than his win-loss record suggests, with excellent swinging strike rates and velocity that contribute to his strong pNERD. Ryan Gusto counters with a 6-4 record but elevated 5.18 ERA, though he averages over a strikeout per inning and has reached four strikeouts in nine of 13 starts.

The series stands tied 1-1 after Houston snapped a five-game losing streak with a 7-4 victory Tuesday, collecting 13 hits. Washington's offense ranks middling (18th in batting average, 18th in runs) while their pitching staff struggles mightily, ranking 28th in ERA and dead last in bullpen ERA at 5.69. Houston sits 61-47 and has thrived when generating offense, going 41-19 when recording eight or more hits. The contrasting team strengths and Gore's potential for dominance despite recent hiccups make this a worthwhile watch for fans seeking quality pitching with offensive upside.

## New York Mets @ San Diego Padres, 4:10p

### Summary

**This game features a solid pitching matchup and team imbalance that should deliver moderate entertainment value, with the Mets' strong offensive metrics facing a struggling Yu Darvish in his second start back from injury.**

Clay Holmes enters with a 9-5 record and 3.40 ERA for the first-place Mets, while Yu Darvish returns with an 0-3 record and 9.18 ERA in his early comeback from elbow inflammation. Darvish missed significant time after a setback in May and essentially restarted his rehab process, making this only his second start of the season. The gNERD score of 8.75 sits below today's average of 9.83 but well above the historical range minimum, suggesting decent watchability without being exceptional.

The team disparity drives much of the intrigue. The Mets' tNERD of 8.69 reflects strong underlying metrics across the board, particularly their 1.46 barrel rate component and significant luck factor of 1.06, indicating they've been underperforming their talent level. The Padres' anemic 2.63 tNERD stems from poor barrel rate production (-1.24) and below-average baserunning, creating a mismatch that favors New York's offense. The Padres are attempting to sweep the series, adding stakes to what could be a competitive game despite the underlying metrics suggesting Mets advantages.

Holmes' modest 3.09 pNERD reflects average performance, while Darvish's 0.00 pNERD indicates insufficient data for evaluation given his limited action this season.

## Toronto Blue Jays @ Baltimore Orioles, 12:35p

### Summary

**This game offers solid watchability with an 8.13 gNERD score that sits comfortably in the middle tier of today's slate, driven by Toronto's strong team metrics and a pitching matchup that could produce competitive baseball.** The Blue Jays' 6.86 tNERD score reflects their strong fielding (1.68 component) and luck factor (1.11), suggesting they've been underperforming their true talent level and are due for positive regression.

The Orioles are riding a five-game winning streak and swept the first three games of this series, creating an interesting dynamic where Toronto (63-46) enters as the better team record-wise against Baltimore (50-58). José Berríos has struggled recently with a 6.12 ERA in July, despite his respectable 2.60 pNERD score, while Dean Kremer brings a 4.23 ERA and 99 strikeouts in 121⅓ innings with a slightly better 3.70 pNERD.

The statistical contrast is compelling: Toronto excels defensively and has been unlucky, while Baltimore's offense has been clicking lately despite weaker underlying metrics. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has dominated Kremer historically with five home runs in 31 appearances (.355 average), providing a key individual matchup to watch. The Blue Jays' superior fielding runs (29.7 vs -19.9) could prove decisive in a close game, especially given both pitchers' modest strikeout rates that will put balls in play.

## Philadelphia Phillies @ Chicago White Sox, 2:10p

### Summary

**This game sits near the bottom of today's watchability spectrum, offering a below-average gNERD score of 7.75 that ranks well below the day's 9.83 average.** The Phillies' solid 6.42 tNERD helps elevate what would otherwise be a dreary affair, but the White Sox's dismal 2.35 tNERD and pedestrian pitching matchup keep this series finale from reaching must-watch territory.

Adrian Houser brings a surprising 6-2 record and stellar 2.10 ERA to the mound for Chicago, making this his likely final audition before the trade deadline. The right-hander has recorded a 2.10 ERA over 11 starts and allowed one run or less in six of those turns, representing one of the few bright spots for a White Sox team sitting at 39-69. His 3.91 pNERD reflects decent underlying metrics despite some swing-and-miss concerns.

Taijuan Walker counters with a more modest 2.82 pNERD, hampered by poor swinging strike rates and strike percentages that suggest trouble generating consistent outs. Walker enters with a 3-5 record and 3.84 ERA over 68 2/3 innings, though his faster pace provides a small entertainment boost. The Phillies' offensive firepower offers the game's main appeal, with their strong batting runs and baserunning components driving their above-average team score.

The Phillies recently won against the White Sox 6-3 in this series, and their playoff positioning creates some stakes against Chicago's rebuilding efforts. However, with both pitchers showing concerning strikeout limitations and the White Sox's across-the-board struggles dragging down the overall product, this matchup falls short of compelling viewing despite Philadelphia's solid fundamentals.

## Miami Marlins @ St. Louis Cardinals, 7:45p

### Summary

**This middling matchup features two struggling pitchers throwing to two teams that are playing out the string, with both the Cardinals and Marlins sitting well below .500 and having already committed to selling at the trade deadline.** The 7.75 gNERD score sits well below today's average of 9.83, making this one of the less compelling games on the slate.

Miles Mikolas brings a 4.94 ERA through 102 2/3 innings and has been wildly inconsistent, with two scoreless outings in his past four starts but the other two saw him give up 13 runs in 10 innings. His pNERD of 2.28 reflects his struggles, particularly with his xFIP- of 115 indicating below-average effectiveness. Cal Quantrill allowed just one run on three hits in five innings against Milwaukee in his last start, but he's 3-8 with a 5.05 ERA overall and has been particularly poor on the road with a 5.76 ERA in 11 road starts. Both pitchers' pNERD scores hover around 2.4, well below today's average of 4.70.

The Marlins' tNERD of 6.12 gets a boost from their young roster (age component of 1.96) and low payroll (1.42), while their actual on-field performance drags them down with negative components in batting, barrel rate, and baserunning. They've been more dangerous on the road, averaging 4.9 runs compared to 3.7 at home. The Cardinals' 4.63 tNERD reflects a team that's slightly better at the fundamentals but lacks the youth factor that helps Miami's score.

The Cardinals have dropped to nine games out of the NL Central and 3.5 games behind the final Wild Card spot, leading them to commit to being sellers before the trade deadline. Miami just shut out St. Louis 5-0 behind Sandy Alcantara's five scoreless innings, giving them momentum in this rubber match. With both teams playing for little more than pride, this game lacks the urgency and star power that typically drives watchability.

## Los Angeles Dodgers @ Cincinnati Reds, 7:10p

### Summary

**This game sits well below today's average watchability despite featuring baseball's biggest star making his seventh pitching start of the season.** While Ohtani's two-way presence adds novelty, his limited pitch count and the overall moderate NERD scores suggest a game that's more curiosity than must-watch entertainment.

Ohtani leads the NL in home runs and MLB in runs scored, and he's expected to stretch out to four innings, marking his longest outing as he returns from Tommy John surgery. However, his 0.00 pNERD reflects the lack of statistical data rather than poor performance - he's posted a 1.50 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 12⅔ innings across six starts. The intrigue comes with a caveat: Ohtani struck out four times in Tuesday's game, breaking a nine-game hitting streak, showing even superstars have off nights.

The matchup itself presents modest entertainment value. Martinez's 2.73 pNERD sits below today's average, with his negative xFIP and swinging strike components suggesting he's been somewhat fortunate. Martinez has struggled at home with a 5.76 ERA, which could benefit the Dodgers' superior offense. The team NERD scores tell the story clearly - the Dodgers' 6.13 reflects strong batting and barrel rate metrics, while Cincinnati's 3.71 is dragged down by poor barrel rate and batting runs.

The Dodgers have won the first two games of this series and look to complete a sweep, adding some competitive stakes. Great American Ball Park's homer-friendly confines could produce fireworks, but with a gNERD of 7.65 ranking near the bottom of today's slate, this game offers more historical novelty than genuine entertainment value.

## Colorado Rockies @ Cleveland Guardians, 6:40p

### Summary

**This game between the lowly Rockies and a Guardians team in organizational chaos offers more intrigue than its below-average gNERD score suggests, particularly with Cleveland's bullpen in complete disarray following Emmanuel Clase's gambling suspension.**

With a gNERD of 6.78, this matchup ranks at the bottom of today's games and well below the historical average. The Rockies' abysmal 1.97 tNERD reflects their 28-79 record and negative contributions across nearly every offensive and defensive category. Kyle Freeland (2-10, 5.24 ERA) allowed four solo homers in his last start against Baltimore, though his road splits are notably better than his overall numbers. The Guardians' 5.06 tNERD is buoyed by solid fielding and young roster construction, but their offensive struggles are evident in their negative batting runs.

The pitching matchup features two lefties with contrasting profiles. Freeland's 4.24 pNERD benefits from decent strike-throwing ability, while Allard's surface numbers look good, but his underlying metrics suggest he's been fortunate rather than dominant. His 2.29 pNERD reflects poor xFIP and swinging strike metrics that suggest regression is coming.

Cleveland's bullpen has been completely upended by Emmanuel Clase's suspension, forcing the entire relief corps into new roles, with Monday's game showing immediate consequences when Cade Smith blew the save in the 9th inning. This organizational turmoil, combined with the Guardians being 3 1/2 games out of the final American League wild-card spot with Thursday's trade deadline looming, creates an unexpectedly compelling backdrop for what would otherwise be a forgettable late-season game.
