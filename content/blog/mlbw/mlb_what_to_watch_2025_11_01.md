Here are today's MLB games, ordered by watchability, based on how interesting the teams and starting pitchers look. Higher is better. For more information, [read this post](https://andrewenfield.com/blog/2025/08/07/how-to-choose-which-baseball-game-to-watch).

Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Los Angeles Dodgers @ Toronto Blue Jays, 5:00p

### Summary

**Max Scherzer gets a second crack at a World Series Game 7, while the Dodgers answer with a choose‑your‑own‑adventure staff card.** **That veteran-versus-voltron setup makes this more watchable than its merely above‑average gNERD implies.**

At 11.81, the gNERD sits above the historical median for past slates and is today’s top score by default, but the appeal is the contrast: the Dodgers’ loud bats (plus a deep, high‑leverage bullpen) against a Blue Jays club that rates well on the run‑prevention side, especially with the glove. Scherzer is the headline; he’ll become the only living pitcher to start two World Series Game 7s, a feat built on experience as much as stuff, and he just won a turn in the ALCS after an injury‑choppy year.  The Dodgers’ starter is TBD because Tyler Glasnow slammed the door in Game 6; Dave Roberts says Shohei Ohtani could cover the first few frames, with Glasnow looming again if needed.  With a pNERD gap (Scherzer above average, Dodgers’ arm unknown) and both teams’ tNERDs solid, expect a tight, tactical watch: Toronto leaning on defense and veteran savvy, Los Angeles on depth, patience, and barrel rate, with every warm body in the pen live.
