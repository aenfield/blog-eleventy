Here are today's MLB games, ordered by watchability, based on how interesting the teams and starting pitchers look. Higher is better.

This is inspired by [Carson Cistulli's NERD scores](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/introducing-team-nerd/) at FanGraphs. (I'll write a bit about the details of [my implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/aenfield/mlb-watchability) soon, and then link to that from this intro.)

Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I might also show 'no data' when I'm not correctly linking the schedule information with a pitcher's stats, like if the names don't match (I have an open issue to improve this).


# Detail

## Tampa Bay Rays @ New York Yankees, 10:05a

### Summary

**This matchup features a clear pitching disparity that could produce offensive fireworks, but the zero NERD scores suggest statistical data issues may obscure what appears to be a compelling game on paper.**

The Yankees and Rays complete their four-game series with New York leading 2-1, setting up a potential series split scenario that adds competitive stakes. With Ryan Pepiot taking the mound against the struggling Marcus Stroman, the Rays have a prime opportunity to salvage a split despite their recent struggles.

The pitching matchup tells the story here. Pepiot brings a 3.42 ERA and 1.15 WHIP with 124 strikeouts, while Stroman counters with a concerning 6.09 ERA and 1.59 WHIP through just 23 strikeouts. Stroman has struggled mightily since returning from his IL stint, allowing 19 runs in 22 innings, while Pepiot has been one of the Rays' most consistent starters. There's no number that paints Stroman in a good light, with metrics in the 5th percentile or lower including expected ERA, strikeout rate, and hard-hit rate.

Brandon Lowe's return from the injured list proved immediately impactful, as the Rays went just 3-15 in the 18 games he missed. The Rays have lost eight of their past 10 games and are falling below .500, while the Yankees are hanging on to a playoff position, but the Yankees have committed 16 errors in their last 12 games, suggesting defensive vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

The zero NERD scores across all categories indicate missing statistical data rather than actual performance metrics, making this analysis rely heavily on traditional statistics that point toward an entertaining offensive game between two teams with contrasting momentum.

## Atlanta Braves @ Cincinnati Reds, 4:10p

### Summary

**This game features one of the season's most lopsided pitching matchups, with Andrew Abbott's stellar 2.09 ERA facing Carlos Carrasco's woeful 5.91 mark in what amounts to a desperation start for injury-ravaged Atlanta.** While the zero NERD scores reflect missing statistical data rather than actual game quality, the underlying storylines make this worth watching for fans who enjoy watching elite pitching dominate struggling lineups.

Abbott enters with a dominant 2.09 ERA and 1.07 WHIP over 103 innings, establishing himself as one of the league's top left-handed starters with a 4.2 WAR. His last outing saw him allow just one earned run on two hits over six innings against Tampa Bay, continuing his strong home performance where he's posted a 1.98 ERA over 56 innings at Great American Ballpark. Meanwhile, Carrasco makes his season debut and first appearance in over a year after posting a 5.91 ERA in eight appearances with the Yankees earlier this season, allowing seven home runs in just 32 innings.

The team contexts add to the watchability. The Reds sit just three games back of an NL Wild Card spot after acquiring Ke'Bryan Hayes and Zack Littell at the trade deadline, while the Braves continue to spiral with their injury-ravaged roster. Atlanta lost Ronald Acu√±a Jr. to a calf injury and has a brutal 19-36 road record. Braves pitchers have posted a 6.52 ERA over their last 10 games while allowing 11 home runs, setting up Abbott for potential strikeout opportunities against a Braves lineup striking out 8.67 times per game.

## Texas Rangers @ Seattle Mariners, 6:40p

### Summary

**This game offers absolutely no analytical value, with both teams and pitchers registering perfect zeros across all NERD metrics - a statistical impossibility that suggests missing data rather than any meaningful assessment.** **The matchup itself tells a more compelling story: two AL West rivals separated by just one game in the standings, with Seattle holding a commanding 7-2 season series advantage.**

The Rangers (56-52) visit the Mariners (57-51) in a crucial four-game series opener, with just one game separating these Wild Card contenders in the AL West standings, though Seattle already holds a 7-2 advantage in their season series. George Kirby (5-5, 4.50 ERA) takes the mound for Seattle against Kumar Rocker (4-4, 5.73 ERA), with both pitchers carrying elevated ERAs that suggest offensive opportunities. Rocker has shown flashes despite his struggles, including six scoreless innings against Detroit recently, though he's 3-3 with a 4.05 ERA in three career games against Seattle. Kirby has been more reliable lately, with Seattle winning four of his last five starts.

The offensive contrast is notable: Seattle boasts Cal Raleigh's impressive 41 home runs and 87 RBIs, while Texas relies on emerging talents like Wyatt Langford and veteran power from Adolis Garcia. The Mariners rank fifth in the AL with a .320 team on-base percentage, while Texas has been explosive when connecting, posting a 25-8 record in games with multiple home runs. Without meaningful NERD data to guide expectations, this becomes a straightforward divisional matchup between teams fighting for playoff positioning, with Seattle's home field advantage and season series dominance providing the clearest edge.
