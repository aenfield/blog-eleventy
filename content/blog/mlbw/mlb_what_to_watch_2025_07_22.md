Here are today's MLB games, ordered by watchability, based on how interesting the teams and starting pitchers look. Higher is better.

This is inspired by [Carson Cistulli's NERD scores](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/introducing-team-nerd/) at FanGraphs. (I'll write a bit about the details of [my implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/aenfield/mlb-watchability) soon, and then link to that from this intro.)

Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I might also show 'no data' when I'm not correctly linking the schedule information with a pitcher's stats, like if the names don't match (I have an open issue to improve this).
