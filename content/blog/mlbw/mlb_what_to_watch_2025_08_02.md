Here are today's MLB games, ordered by watchability, based on how interesting the teams and starting pitchers look. Higher is better.

This is inspired by [Carson Cistulli's NERD scores](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/introducing-team-nerd/) at FanGraphs. (I'll write a bit about the details of [my implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/aenfield/mlb-watchability) soon, and then link to that from this intro.)

Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I might also show 'no data' when I'm not correctly linking the schedule information with a pitcher's stats, like if the names don't match (I have an open issue to improve this).


# Detail

## Detroit Tigers @ Philadelphia Phillies, 1:05p

### Summary

**This matchup features the highest gNERD score of the day at 19.83, driven by a historic pitching duel between two Cy Young frontrunners that could make baseball history.** The game pits reigning AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal against Zack Wheeler, with only once in MLB history have the eventual winners of the award pitched against each other during the regular season.

Skubal's exceptional 14.38 pNERD reflects his dominance this season, as he currently leads all pitchers in FIP (1.92), WHIP (0.838), strikeout-to-walk-ratio (9.00) and WAR (5.4) while aiming to become the first repeat winner of the junior circuit's Cy Young Award since Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez did it in 1999 and 2000. Wheeler's solid 10.14 pNERD comes from his 172 strikeouts leading the National League and 0.890 WHIP. 

The Tigers' superior 8.74 tNERD is boosted by their baserunning excellence and younger roster, while the Phillies' 6.40 tNERD suffers from their massive payroll penalty. Detroit's bullpen struggles were evident as four Tigers relievers gave up four of the Phillies' five runs on Friday, making Skubal's ability to pitch deep crucial. Skubal has not allowed any runs on three hits with one walk and seven strikeouts over seven innings in his one career appearance against the Phillies, adding intrigue to this elite pitching matchup between division leaders.

## Atlanta Braves @ Cincinnati Reds, 4:15p

### Summary

**This game offers a compelling matchup between two young power arms at the historic MLB Speedway Classic, with rookie phenom Chase Burns' electric stuff facing Spencer Strider's proven dominance in what will be the largest regular season crowd in MLB history.** The gNERD score of 15.16 ranks well above today's average of 10.45 and sits in the upper tier of historical scores, driven primarily by Burns' outstanding pitching metrics.

Burns, the 22-year-old second overall pick from 2024, has struck out 45 hitters in just 27.1 innings despite his 6.26 ERA, and his pNERD of 14.07 reflects elite underlying skills with a 63 xFIP- and 98.4 mph fastball velocity. His record $9.25 million signing bonus speaks to his ceiling, while his three straight starts with 10+ strikeouts suggest he's finding his groove. Strider's more modest 6.92 pNERD comes from solid velocity and swing-and-miss ability, though his 2.91 ERA over his past nine starts shows improvement after elbow surgery recovery.

The setting adds considerable appeal - over 85,000 tickets sold for what will be MLB's largest regular season attendance at Bristol Motor Speedway, with both Tennessee natives pitching in their home state. The Reds' strong baserunning (0.94 component) contrasts with the Braves' defensive edge (0.88), while both teams show signs of positive regression with Atlanta's luck component at 1.10. The Braves lead the season series 4-2, making this a meaningful rubber match in a unique venue.

## New York Yankees @ Miami Marlins, 1:10p

### Summary

**This game pits an unproven rookie against one of baseball's most promising young arms, creating a stark mismatch that favors Miami despite their underdog status.** With the Yankees' bullpen in shambles after blowing multiple leads in Friday's 13-12 loss and Aaron Judge still sidelined, this becomes a test of whether Eury Pérez can exploit a vulnerable New York squad.

The gNERD score of 14.53 sits well above today's average of 10.45, placing it in the upper tier of watchable games. Pérez is arguably the crown jewel of the Marlins' organization, carefully managed and protected and still battling injuries at the same time (he just returned in June from Tommy John surgery). His 3.07 ERA and 2.75 FIP will raise eyebrows from anyone in the game, a huge factor in that being his four-seam fastball, one of the best heaters in the game. His pNERD of 7.34 reflects his elite velocity (98 mph) and youth advantage, making him the clear focal point for entertainment value.

Schlittler has impressed with certain of his tools in his first three MLB starts, but the big problem is those walks. The rookie lost on Monday against Tampa Bay in no small part to the four walks in 4.1 innings, a rate that isn't sustainable no matter how many 100-mph fastballs you throw. His zero pNERD score indicates limited statistical data available, but his 4.91 ERA and 1.84 WHIP suggest struggles ahead against Miami's improved offense.

The Yankees' strong offensive metrics (8.02 tNERD) provide some balance, particularly their elite barrel rate component, but the Yankees are still without Aaron Judge, and their bullpen is reeling after Friday's catastrophic meltdown creates additional intrigue around whether they can maintain leads.

## Arizona Diamondbacks @ Athletics, 7:05p

### Summary

**This matchup offers moderate entertainment value with two teams heading in opposite directions and a pitching duel between contrasting styles.** Arizona enters on a six-game losing streak while the Athletics have won three straight and seven of their last eight.

With a gNERD score of 12.68, this game sits comfortably above today's average of 10.45 and well within the upper half of the historical range. The Athletics' strong team NERD of 7.94 reflects their surprising power surge - they rank fourth in the AL with 152 total home runs - while their significant luck component of 2.00 suggests they've been underperforming their underlying metrics. Arizona's team NERD of 7.18 is bolstered by solid batting runs and their own luck factor, indicating potential for better performance than their recent slide suggests.

The pitching matchup presents an intriguing contrast in trajectories. Zac Gallen has struggled to the tune of a 5.60 ERA this season, a dramatic fall for the former Cy Young contender whose pNERD of 4.25 reflects his diminished effectiveness. Gallen was recently passed over during the trade deadline, as other teams were not willing to pay a prospect price in excess of the value of the qualifying offer, which was a jarring reality and likely a surprise to the pitcher himself. Meanwhile, J.T. Ginn's higher pNERD of 5.98 is driven by excellent underlying metrics, particularly his 75 xFIP- that translates to a massive 3.13 component. His last time out came against the Houston Astros, when he went six scoreless innings while giving up three hits, and he's been lights out in two recent starts.

The game features two teams with contrasting offensive profiles - Arizona's solid .323 team OBP versus Sacramento's power-heavy approach - playing in the hitter-friendly confines of Sutter Health Park, where home runs should be plentiful.

## Los Angeles Dodgers @ Tampa Bay Rays, 10:10a

### Summary

**Blake Snell's long-awaited return to the mound against his former team creates a compelling storyline that elevates this game above its middling gNERD score of 12.31.** The two-time Cy Young winner's first start since April makes this matchup worth watching despite the lack of statistical data for his pNERD calculation.

Snell returns from a four-month absence due to left shoulder inflammation, and his rehab work looks promising with a 1.32 ERA and 24-to-5 strikeout-to-walk ratio across four minor league starts. The velocity is back too, as he was hitting 97 mph in his last rehab outing. This homecoming adds intrigue since Snell spent his first five seasons with Tampa Bay, though his 6.30 ERA in two previous starts against his former team suggests some struggles.

The game's gNERD score of 12.31 sits comfortably above today's average of 10.45, primarily driven by Drew Rasmussen's solid 6.45 pNERD. Rasmussen brings an 8-5 record with a 2.96 ERA and has been stellar over his five years with Tampa Bay, posting a 2.78 ERA. His statistical profile shows good velocity at 95.7 mph and decent control, making him a reliable opponent for Snell's return.

The Dodgers' strong 6.10 tNERD reflects their offensive prowess, particularly in batting runs and barrel rate, while the Rays' 5.64 tNERD benefits from excellent baserunning and their payroll efficiency bonus. Tampa Bay will be missing All-Star first baseman Jonathan Aranda due to a wrist fracture, which could impact their already modest offensive output. The pitching matchup between a returning ace and a steady veteran, combined with Snell's emotional return to Tampa Bay, makes this a game worth prioritizing despite the moderate NERD components.

## Texas Rangers @ Seattle Mariners, 1:10p

### Summary

**This game offers a compelling showcase of two quality pitchers with playoff implications on the line, elevated by Merrill Kelly's Rangers debut after a trade deadline acquisition.** The gNERD score of 10.87 sits right at today's average, making it a solid mid-tier option among the day's slate.

Merrill Kelly makes his Rangers debut after being acquired from Arizona, adding intrigue to what's already a meaningful AL West matchup. Texas boasts the majors' lowest rotation ERA at 3.25, yet still added Kelly to bolster their playoff push. His pNERD of 5.43 reflects solid underlying metrics, particularly his excellent xFIP- of 89 that translates to strong run prevention ability. Kelly previously dominated Seattle with six scoreless innings in June, though he's 0-1 with a 2.45 ERA in two career starts against them.

Castillo's pNERD of 5.40 is nearly identical, backed by his 7.8 strikeouts per home start average and four wins in his last five outings. T-Mobile Park's extreme pitcher-friendly environment with a 0.843 run factor should enhance both starters' effectiveness. The Mariners' slight tNERD edge (5.71 vs 5.19) comes from superior batting runs and some positive luck regression potential. Texas has dropped the first two games of this series and eight straight in Seattle, adding desperation to their playoff positioning battle.

## Kansas City Royals @ Toronto Blue Jays, 12:07p

### Summary

**This game sits right at today's average for entertainment value, offering a solid pitching matchup between a young lefty and a Hall of Fame veteran working through struggles.** With a gNERD score of 10.65 that matches today's average of 10.45, this contest falls squarely in the middle of the watchability spectrum.

Noah Cameron has been outstanding this season with a 2.44 ERA and 1.00 WHIP, and his strong pNERD score of 6.52 reflects solid underlying metrics including good control and a fast pace that keeps games moving. The 25-year-old lefty has been consistent both at home and on the road, making him a reliable entertainment option. On the other side, Max Scherzer is still shaking off rust in Toronto and this is not yet the same Scherzer that we're used to seeing. His 4.93 pNERD suggests mediocre performance despite his legendary status, with his 4.89 ERA reflecting ongoing adjustment issues.

The team dynamics add some intrigue: Toronto's superior 6.65 tNERD benefits from strong fielding metrics and solid batting runs, while Kansas City's modest 3.20 tNERD is weighed down by poor offensive production. The Kansas City Royals will attempt to keep their three-game win streak going after beating the Blue Jays 9-3 on Friday night, where newly acquired Mike Yastrzemski homered in his first at-bat with Kansas City. The Royals' recent offensive surge could continue against a Scherzer still finding his form.

## Milwaukee Brewers @ Washington Nationals, 1:05p

### Summary

**This matchup offers a compelling pitcher-versus-pitcher showdown that makes for solid viewing, with Brandon Woodruff's dominant return from injury facing off against Jake Irvin's home run vulnerability.** The game's gNERD score of 10.52 sits right at today's average but benefits from excellent individual components that create an entertaining dynamic.

Woodruff has been outstanding since returning from injury with a 2.01 ERA and 3.36 FIP over four starts, and historically dominates Washington with a 1.29 ERA and 55 strikeouts in 42 career innings against them. His pNERD score of 8.64 reflects elite performance metrics, particularly his strong xFIP- and strike rate components. On the other side, Irvin has allowed an NL-worst 23 home runs this season and could be vulnerable against Milwaukee's power. His pNERD of just 2.09 stems from poor xFIP- and swinging strike metrics.

The team contrast adds intrigue: Milwaukee's 8.06 tNERD is boosted by strong baserunning and fielding components, while Washington's 2.25 reflects struggles across most areas. The Brewers enter with momentum after William Contreras had five hits Friday, and they hold a 4-0 season series advantage. Milwaukee currently has the best record in baseball and brings their National League-leading rotation to face a Nationals team that underwent roster changes at the trade deadline. The pitching mismatch creates clear expectations, but Irvin's inconsistency means he could either get shelled or surprise with one of his better outings.

## Houston Astros @ Boston Red Sox, 1:10p

### Summary

**This game offers middling entertainment value despite its decent gNERD score, featuring two struggling starters who should provide plenty of offensive opportunities in a hitter-friendly venue.** The 9.66 gNERD lands slightly below today's average but well above the historical floor, suggesting moderate watchability driven more by offensive potential than pitching excellence.

Colton Gordon has struggled all season with a 4.74 ERA and his underlying metrics support that assessment - his pNERD of 5.71 is elevated primarily by age and pace factors rather than actual pitching effectiveness. Walker Buehler is coming off a strong July with a 3.57 ERA, though his season-long 5.72 ERA tells a different story, and his pNERD of 1.74 reflects significant struggles with command and missing bats. The matchup features two pitchers with ERAs north of 4.70 facing lineups that can capitalize on mistakes.

Boston enters riding momentum from a dramatic 10-inning walkoff victory Friday night, with 21-year-old Roman Anthony delivering the game-winner. The Red Sox's 7.32 tNERD significantly outpaces Houston's 4.55, driven by superior performance across multiple categories including barrel rate and baserunning. The series carries added intrigue with Carlos Correa returning to Houston after being traded from Minnesota, creating storyline value beyond the statistical matchup.

Fenway Park ranks fourth in MLB with a 1.093 run factor, particularly favoring doubles production, which should benefit both offenses given the starting pitchers' command issues. The combination of struggling starters, capable lineups, and a hitter-friendly venue suggests offensive fireworks, though the pitching performances themselves may lack the artistry that elevates truly compelling games.

## Baltimore Orioles @ Chicago Cubs, 11:20a

### Summary

**This game offers a compelling contrast between a Cubs team firing on all cylinders and an Orioles squad that's fallen well short of expectations, with the pitching matchup heavily favoring Chicago.** With a gNERD score of 9.42 that sits comfortably above today's average, this matchup benefits from the Cubs' exceptional offensive production and Matthew Boyd's All-Star caliber season.

The Cubs send All-Star LHP Matthew Boyd (11-4, 2.47 ERA) to the mound, and the Orioles go with RHP Tomoyuki Sugano (8-5, 4.38), creating a stark contrast in effectiveness. Boyd's pNERD of 4.97 reflects his outstanding command and swing-and-miss stuff, while Sugano is coming off his best start in nearly two months, holding the Colorado Rockies to one run and four hits over six innings, though his overall 1.53 pNERD suggests continued struggles. The Cubs' tNERD of 9.43 ranks at the top of today's range, driven by their 1.60 batting runs component and strong across-the-board metrics that have them positioned as legitimate NL Central contenders. Meanwhile, Baltimore's 2.89 tNERD reflects their disappointing season, with negative components in baserunning and fielding dragging down their watchability.

The Cubs have the highest team batting average in the NL at .255 and won Friday's opener 1-0 in just 1 hour, 49 minutes, setting up an intriguing follow-up. While Baltimore has struggled through a disappointing 2025 campaign that's seen them become sellers at the trade deadline, the Cubs have established themselves as legitimate contenders in the NL Central race. The 35-year-old Sugano represents an interesting storyline as a rookie who has never faced the Cubs, though his middling strikeout rate and tendency to allow home runs could prove problematic against Chicago's potent lineup.

## Minnesota Twins @ Cleveland Guardians, 1:10p

### Summary

**This matchup offers below-average entertainment value as both teams navigate significant challenges - the Twins fielding a decimated roster after their historic trade deadline sell-off while Bailey Ober returns from injury with questionable effectiveness.**

With a gNERD score of 7.98, this game falls well below today's average of 10.45 and sits in the lower third of the typical range. The Twins enter on a three-game losing streak after trading away 11 players in a 24-hour period, essentially fielding what amounts to a Triple-A roster. Bailey Ober returns from the 15-day IL with a hip injury after struggling to a 5.28 ERA this season, making his effectiveness and stamina highly questionable. His pNERD of 2.98 reflects poor expected performance metrics, with his xFIP- of 119 indicating he's been 19% worse than league average.

Tanner Bibee provides the more compelling storyline with a respectable 4.49 pNERD and three straight wins, though his overall 7-9 record and 4.31 ERA suggest he's merely adequate. The Guardians hold a commanding 5-2 season series advantage and benefit from playing at home where they've been solid at 28-26. Minnesota's bullpen has been completely gutted after trading away their entire high-leverage relief corps, creating a massive disadvantage in late-game situations.

The low team NERD scores reflect both clubs' offensive limitations - Cleveland ranks 23rd in runs scored while Minnesota's power has been depleted by trades. With both pitchers capable of limiting damage and Progressive Field's pitcher-friendly dimensions, this shapes up as a low-scoring affair that lacks the star power or compelling narratives to make it appointment viewing.

## Pittsburgh Pirates @ Colorado Rockies, 12:10p

### Summary

**This game offers a compelling pitching duel between one of baseball's most promising young stars and a struggling veteran, set against the backdrop of Colorado's offensive explosion from the previous night.** The gNERD score of 7.66 places this matchup well below today's average of 10.45, but Paul Skenes' exceptional 11.23 pNERD makes him worth watching regardless.

Skenes brings a 13-inning scoreless streak into this matchup and hasn't allowed a run since July 11, showcasing the dominance reflected in his elite pNERD components. His 98.1 mph fastball velocity and exceptional swing-and-miss rate create must-see television, especially facing the Rockies for the first time at Coors Field. The 23-year-old rookie's 1.83 ERA and 146 strikeouts through 133 innings demonstrate why his pNERD towers over the field.

On the other side, Austin Gomber's dismal -0.86 pNERD tells the story of a pitcher struggling mightily. He's seeking his first win of the season and first career victory against Pittsburgh, carrying a 6.44 ERA in nine appearances against the Pirates. His poor xFIP- of 139 suggests the struggles are deserved, creating a stark contrast that could lead to offensive fireworks for Pittsburgh.

The team components dampen excitement somewhat, with both clubs posting below-average tNERD scores. However, the Pirates are looking to bounce back after blowing a 9-0 lead in Friday's wild 17-16 loss, adding narrative tension to Skenes' quest to restore order. While not among today's premier games, the Skenes factor alone makes this worth monitoring.

## San Francisco Giants @ New York Mets, 1:10p

### Summary

**This matchup offers a stark pitching contrast that makes it worth watching: the Mets' elite Kodai Senga against a Giants rookie making his season debut after struggling badly in limited MLB time last year.** The gNERD score of 7.63 sits below today's average but above historical norms, driven primarily by the Mets' impressive offensive metrics.

Kai-Wei Teng makes his 2025 MLB season debut after being called up following the Giants' trade deadline moves. In 2024, he struggled as a long reliever, recording a 9.82 ERA over 11 innings pitched, though he's enjoying his best Triple-A season since 2023 with a 3.67 ERA and 86 strikeouts over 54 innings. His pNERD of 0.00 reflects the lack of current MLB data.

Kodai Senga enters with a 7-3 record and 2.00 ERA, earning a modest pNERD of 2.63 despite his success. He's unbeaten in his last seven starts, going 3-0 with a 2.80 ERA, with the Mets winning all seven games. His swing-and-miss arsenal should challenge a Giants offense that ranks poorly in runs scored.

The team metrics tell the story: the Mets' tNERD of 8.46 reflects strong offensive components including excellent barrel rate (1.41) and baserunning (0.98), while the Giants' 1.53 tNERD shows struggles across most offensive categories. The Mets have slipped to second in the NL East and lost their last three games, adding urgency to their home performance.

This pitching mismatch between an established ace and an unproven rookie creates compelling viewing, especially with the Mets needing to bounce back from recent struggles.

## St. Louis Cardinals @ San Diego Padres, 7:10p

### Summary

**This game sits well below average in watchability with a gNERD of 4.17, ranking near the bottom of today's slate and offering little to entice casual viewers.** The stark contrast between a promising Cardinals pitcher and a struggling Padres starter creates the primary intrigue.

Michael McGreevy brings a respectable 3.43 pNERD despite limited experience, having pitched just 56 innings with 37 strikeouts and a 3.64 FIP. The 24-year-old right-hander has shown flashes since spending most of the season at Triple-A Memphis before earning a rotation spot when the Cardinals designated Erick Fedde for assignment on July 23. His youth provides the main positive component to his pitcher score, though his limited swing-and-miss ability and below-average velocity drag down his overall contribution.

Randy Vásquez presents a concerning matchup with his -2.34 pNERD, anchored by a troubling 146 xFIP- that suggests significant underlying struggles. His last outing against these same Cardinals was encouraging, allowing just one earned run over 4⅔ innings, but his season-long 4.0 FIP and poor strike-throwing metrics indicate deeper issues.

The Cardinals' superior team metrics (4.53 tNERD versus 2.73) stem largely from excellent fielding that ranks fifth in baseball with a .989 fielding percentage. However, San Diego enters riding a six-game winning streak, though their offensive struggles are evident in ranking second-lowest in baseball with just 92 home runs. The pitching mismatch and Cardinals' defensive strength provide the game's most compelling analytical angle, but the overall low entertainment value makes this a skip for most viewers seeking premium baseball action.

## Chicago White Sox @ Los Angeles Angels, 7:07p

### Summary

**This matchup between two struggling teams offers little entertainment value, ranking dead last among today's games with a gNERD of just 3.63.** **Both pitchers bring significant red flags to the mound, with Civale's abysmal swing-and-miss rate and Hendricks showing his age at 35 with diminished velocity.**

The White Sox arrive with a 40-69 record after beating the Angels 6-3 on Friday night behind home runs from Andrew Benintendi and Lenyn Sosa. Their tNERD of 2.53 reflects deep problems across the board, with negative contributions from batting, fielding, and baserunning. The Angels at 53-56 fare only marginally better with a 2.80 tNERD, boosted primarily by their barrel rate but hampered by poor fielding.

Aaron Civale (2-6) makes his 14th start after throwing five scoreless innings against the Cubs in his last outing, though his pNERD of 0.07 suggests this was an outlier. His xFIP- of 123 indicates below-average effectiveness, while his swing-and-miss rate sits at a paltry 0.1%. Civale requested a trade from Milwaukee after being bumped from their rotation, eventually landing with Chicago where he's auditioning for another deadline flip.

Kyle Hendricks (6-7, 4.72 ERA) takes the mound for his 21st start with 70 strikeouts in 106⅔ innings. His pNERD of 1.87 is misleading given his poor underlying metrics - his 86.4 mph average velocity ranks among the lowest in baseball, and he's posted an 8.50 ERA in four career starts against Chicago. While his strike rate provides some value, age appears to be catching up with the veteran.

With both teams' NERD scores well below today's averages and minimal storylines beyond deadline positioning, this game offers little reason to tune in unless you're a completist seeking to watch every contest.
