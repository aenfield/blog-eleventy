Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Milwaukee Brewers @ Los Angeles Dodgers, 3:08p

### Summary

**This NLCS Game 3 matchup features the highest gNERD score among today's games at 13.77, fueled by the Brewers' exceptional team metrics and a compelling series context where Milwaukee swept LA six times in July but now trails 0-2 in the playoffs.** The series shifts to Los Angeles with the Dodgers holding a 2-0 series lead, and the Brewers facing elimination pressure. The Brewers bring the day's top tNERD at 9.71, driven by strong baserunning (2.12 component) and solid contributions across bullpen and fielding. Their young, low-payroll roster punches above its weight. The Dodgers counter with elite batting (95.1 runs above average) and barrel rate (1.16 component), though their baserunning lags. Tyler Glasnow takes the mound with a 5.23 pNERD, featuring elite velocity at 95.9 mph and a strong xFIP- of 90, though his strike percentage component is notably negative. The Brewers' starter remains undecided, adding uncertainty. Milwaukee's ability to generate offense against LA's high-powered lineup will be critical, especially after outscoring the Dodgers 31-16 during their six regular-season wins. The combination of playoff desperation and strong underlying metrics makes this a compelling watch.

## Toronto Blue Jays @ Seattle Mariners, 5:33p

### Summary

**This ALCS Game 4 matchup features two veteran right-handers with contrasting recent form as Seattle looks to take a commanding 3-1 series lead after Toronto's 13-4 blowout in Game 3.** Max Scherzer is set to make his first playoff start in a Toronto uniform, though the 41-year-old brings concerning numbers after going 1-3 with a 9.00 ERA in his final six starts of the 2025 season. His pNERD of 4.07 reflects middling watchability, with a luck component suggesting he's been somewhat unfortunate, though his xFIP- of 109 indicates below-average effectiveness. Luis Castillo went 11-8 with a 3.54 ERA in 32 regular-season starts, and he is 1-0 with a 0.00 ERA in the postseason, pitching six scoreless innings against Detroit. His pNERD of 5.46 is the higher of the two, backed by solid peripherals including better velocity and a faster pace. The gNERD of 11.17 sits right at the low end of games today but slightly above the historical median, making this a moderately watchable contest. Both teams show strong batting runs but diverge elsewhere—Toronto's fielding (1.60 component) contrasts sharply with Seattle's defensive struggles (-0.93), while the Mariners hold an edge in barrel rate. The postseason stakes elevate what would otherwise be a fairly average regular season matchup.
