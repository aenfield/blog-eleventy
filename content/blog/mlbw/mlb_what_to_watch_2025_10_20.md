Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Seattle Mariners @ Toronto Blue Jays, 5:10p

### Summary

**Game 7 gives you a clean, high-stakes contrast: George Kirby’s precision and power versus Shane Bieber’s comeback guile, with Toronto’s gloves poised to matter again.** **It’s the top watchability play on the board, and not just because the gNERD (14.96) sits above the 95th percentile of historical games—this one also carries fresh, tangible storylines.**

Kirby’s elite skill set (pNERD 9.33; xFIP- 77; upper-90s velo; elite strike rate) screams “ace,” even if his prior start in this matchup was a clunker (8 ER in 4 IP). Bieber countered with six strong, eight Ks in that Game 3 win, and he’s the short-rest redemption arc Toronto traded for in July after Tommy John—exactly this moment.  Toronto just forced this decider 6-2 by turning three inning-ending double plays (two with the bases loaded) while Seattle booted three balls; Vlad Jr. tied the franchise postseason HR mark and Addison Barger kept raking. Expect those gloves to loom again given the Jays’ sterling recent run prevention.  On the model side, Kirby’s miss-bat/low-walk profile edges Bieber (xFIP- 80), but Bieber’s quick pace and form plus a sharper Jays defense narrow it, and both pens grade as merely fine—so every extra out the starters bank is gold.
