Notes:

- **Pitcher 'no data'**: Pitchers only have a pNERD score once they've started at least one game and have at least 20 innings pitched. I also show 'no data' when I can't correctly link a starting pitcher with their stats.

# Detail

## Seattle Mariners @ Toronto Blue Jays, 5:03p

### Summary

**It’s a gNERD headliner: ALCS Game 6 with Seattle one win from its first World Series, matching ace-caliber Logan Gilbert against Toronto’s headline rookie Trey Yesavage.** **Throw in a split-finger that eats hitters and a bruised-but-determined George Springer subplot, and the remote basically chooses itself.** 

Gilbert’s pNERD 10.15 sits near the top of our historical range, driven by an elite 70 xFIP- and 95.4 mph velocity; after a shortened, command-wobbly Game 2 that followed an odd bullpen cameo, he’s back on normal rest for a plausible bounce-back.  Yesavage’s pNERD shows 0 only because the model lacks reps; the résumé doesn’t: 11 strikeouts in 5.1 no-hit ALDS innings and a franchise-record nine K in his debut, with the splitter fueling 19 whiffs. 

The team contrast helps the watchability: Seattle brings real thump (91.7 Batting Runs, 9.5% barrel rate) but wobbly leather, while Toronto’s higher tNERD is buoyed by elite defense (+38.6 Fielding Runs). The subplot matters, too: Springer’s right-knee contusion returned clean X-rays, and he’s expected to try to go. 

Given a gNERD of 13.98—well above the historical median and the clear top of today’s slate—an ace-versus-unknown showdown with series stakes is exactly the kind of weird, tense baseball you make time for.
