This is a first blog post.

I'm using the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator, and write and publish using files with Markdown, Git branches, and GitHub Actions. Compared to the ASP.NET-based [DasBlog](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480016.aspx) engine I used with the first blog with this name, way back in the early 2000s, this approach is cleaner, takes advantage of version control and CI/CD, and doesn't require a server that runs code. All pretty cool!
