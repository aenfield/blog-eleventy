This here's a first blog post, for this blog.

I'm using the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator. Things have changed - for example, widespread hosting and commonly-used CI/CD make actually publishing something a lot easier, thankfully - but there are still similarities to the ASP.NET-based [DasBlog](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480016.aspx) engine I used for the first blog with this name, back in the early 2000s.
