# About

I like to write code and words. I'm a versatile and enthusiastic writer, engineer, and data scientist with extensive experience in technical communication, software engineering, data science, and patents. I love to learn new things in detail. There's more information about my experience on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-enfield/).

If you're interesting in hiring me, send me a message on LinkedIn, or use [email](mailto:aenfield@gmail.com).

## Writing samples

- **My [blog](https://andrewenfield.com)**. This iteration of this blog is only as old as June 2025, and so there's not a lot here yet. I have written a few posts about LLMs/technology/stats and baseball, including:
  - ["How to choose which baseball game to watch"](https://andrewenfield.com/blog/2025/08/07/how-to-choose-which-baseball-game-to-watch/), which explains the system I built to automatically generate a daily ranked list of games.
  - ["Using LLMs to collect MLB broadcast data"](https://andrewenfield.com/blog/2025/06/29/using-llms-to-collect-mlb-broadcast-data-or-which-mlb-broadcasts-show-pitch-types/)
- **Books**. I'm a published author, and wrote chapters of the following books (other authors wrote chapters of the same books). These are old enough to not be available online; I can share more as part of an interview process.
  - [Professional Active Server Pages](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Active-Server-Ges-Instant/dp/1861000723/)
  - [Professional IE4 Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Ie4-Programming-Andrew-Enfield/dp/1861000707/)
  - [Instant Visual Basic 5 ActiveX Control Creation](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Visual-Activex-Control-Creation/dp/1861000235/)
- **Patent applications**. I wrote and filed ~50 patent applications (for others) from 2005-2010. A few examples:
  - ["Data synchronization and sharing relationships"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8370423B2/)
  - ["Clipboard Augmentation"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8020112B2/)
- **Customer-focused documentation**.
  - I wrote a wide array of different kinds of technical documentation for an enterprise software company in Austin in the early 2000s. I can share complete PDFs of some of this documentation as part of an interview process, as it's not appropriate for me to publish the docs here.
  - I wrote tutorials, how-tos, conceptual descriptions, and API reference documentation for Windows CE in 2003 and 2004. None of this work is still available online.
