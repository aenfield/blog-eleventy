# About

I've been writing code and words about code since the early 1990s. I'm an enthusiastic writer and engineer with extensive experience in technical communication, software engineering, data science, patents, and agile practices. I love to learn new things in detail. There's more information on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-enfield/).

If you're interesting in hiring me, send me a message on LinkedIn, or via [email](mailto:aenfield@gmail.com).

## Writing samples

- **Books**. I'm a published author, and wrote chapters of the following books (other authors wrote chapters of the same books):
  - [Professional Active Server Pages](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Active-Server-Ges-Instant/dp/1861000723/)
  - [Professional IE4 Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Ie4-Programming-Andrew-Enfield/dp/1861000707/)
  - [Instant Visual Basic 5 ActiveX Control Creation](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Visual-Activex-Control-Creation/dp/1861000235/)
- **Patent applications**. I wrote ~50 patent applications from 2005-2010. A few examples (as is common with patents, the claims will have been changed during prosecution/after filing by the prosecuting attorney/agent, which wasn't me, but the rest of the applications are my words):
  - ["Data synchronization and sharing relationships"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8370423B2/)
  - ["Clipboard Augmentation"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8020112B2/)
- **Customer-focused documentation**.
  - I wrote an array of documentation for an enterprise software company in Austin, TX in the early 2000s. I can share complete PDFs of some of this documentation as part of an interview process, but it's not appropriate for me to publish the docs here.
  - I wrote tutorials, how-tos and conceptual and API reference documentation for Windows CE in 2003 and 2004. None of that is still available online.
- **This blog**, which doesn't have much as of mid-2025 when I restarted it, but will eventually have more. (I had a first iteration of a blog with the same name and very few posts in the early 2000s, but haven't gone back and republished what I'd written then.)
